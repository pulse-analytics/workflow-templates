# Pulse Workflow Templates

This repository holds reusable GitHub workflow templates that can be referenced by repositories to build your Docker image, tag it appropriately, push it to GitHub Container Registry, and trigger a deployment in AWS.

To reference and use templates, create a `.yml` file in your `/.github/workflows` folder. You can copy/reference the examples below, just be sure to modify the required inputs under "with" to what is appropriate for your repository.
